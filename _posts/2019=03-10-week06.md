## HFOSS
Developing open source software for humanitarian goals seems like a natural way for engineers to use their skills to get involved in doing social good. It seems like these projects could be harder to get involved with as it's unlikely that there's a large community supporting them. Plus, since a lot of these projects are created in response to some kind of disaster, they're probably not actively maintained in the long run. It might also be difficult to tailor the software to the local community that's using it. 

I think that working on an HFOSS project could bring more prestige to the developer as it shows that they're interested in doing good for the world, but hopefully they would be getting involved in these projects because they're genuinely interested in them and not because of some disingenuous, perceived notion of prestige. I'd like to get involved in an HFOSS project in the future provided I had the time and energy to really dedicate myself to it.

### Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ I think it would be suitable for beginner contributors if they're decent with JavaScript, because a lot of the issues with the `good first issue` tag are frontend related. The contributor would probably need to have a better understanding of genomic data and computational bio if they wanted to get really involved.

__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ The maintainers seem helpful and friendly, and invest a lot of time/energy into the project. The couple of active maintainers seem to genuinely care about the project.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ In the discussions for issues and PRs, the people are friendly and respond helpfully.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Yes, PRs get reviewed quickly.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ Yes, the maintainers thank contributors in their contributing guidelines.
