## Marshmallow
The project that I've chosen to evaluate is [Marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/), which is an ORM library for converting datatypes to and from Python objects. 

I decided to choose Marshmallow because it has a pretty decently-sized community behind it, the code is incredibly well documented, and I think the logo is pretty cute. It also seems like a really useful tool that I can see myself using. Plus the fact that the first example they give is for a Bowie album is just the cherry on top.

### Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ I think it would be suitable for beginner contributors if they already have a good understanding of how serialization/deserialization works between ORMs and Python. But, there's not a huge active community (mostly seems like there's 2 or 3 active maintainers) and not a lot of beginner-friendly issues which is a little intimidating.

__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ The maintainers seem really helpful and friendly, and invest a lot of time/energy into the project. The couple of active maintainers seem to genuinely care about the project.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ In the discussions for issues and PRs, the people are friendly and respond helpfully.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Yes, PRs get reviewed very quickly and there's a lot of discussion.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ Yes, the maintainers welcome contributions and participation in the project.
